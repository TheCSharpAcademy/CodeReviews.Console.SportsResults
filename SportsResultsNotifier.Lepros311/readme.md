# Sports Results Notifier

The [Sports Results Notifier](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/19/sports-results) project is the first web scraper project I've done. It scrapes the standings for the Eastern and Western conferences of the NBA and emails them to me daily each morning. This is an Azure Functions project. So it's also the first time I've used Microsoft Azure and the Azure Functions portal to deploy and monitor an app. This project is part of [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) curriculum.
