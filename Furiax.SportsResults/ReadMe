<h2>About the project:</h2>
This application gets sport results (NBA games) from a website and then send these results to the user trough mail.<br>
<br>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
- Build an application that scrapes data using the Agility Pack Library.<br>
- Create a mail function that emails this data to a user using SMPT.<br>
- The data should be scrapped only once per day and send to a specific emailadress.<br>
- This should be a service that runs automatically without interaction.<br>
<br>
<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>

- Had to search for a way to automate the process so no user interaction is necessary <br>
