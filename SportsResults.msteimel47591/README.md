# SportsResults

This is a C# application for The C# Academy roadmap. It utilizes Agility Pack to scrape basketball results from https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/
once a day and emails them to a user.

# Project Requirements

To meet the requirements specified by The C# Academy, the project must do the following:
- This is an application where you should read sports data from a website once a day and send it to a specific e-mail address.
- You don't need any interaction with the program. It will be a service that runs automatically.
- The data should be collected from the Basketball Reference Website in the resources area.
- You should use the Agility Pack library for scrapping.

  # Notes
  I used Papercut for local SMPT testing.
