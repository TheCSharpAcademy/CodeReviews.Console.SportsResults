* This was the first time that I had worked with the HtmlAgilityPack to scrape the data, but with the resources provided it was quite easy.





## ðŸ›  Skills Learned
#### BackgroundService 
- I utilised the BackgroundService class to send the e-mail once every day, which exposed me to cancellation token and how it can benifit the program to have the cancellation token.
