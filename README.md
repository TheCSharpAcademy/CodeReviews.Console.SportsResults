# Sports Data Scraper Service

## Description

This is a simple exercise of web scraping. Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves using software to send HTTP requests to web pages, retrieve their HTML content, and then parse that content to extract the desired information. The extracted data can be stored in a structured format, such as a database or a spreadsheet, for further analysis or use in other applications.

## Requirements

This is an application where you should read sports data from a website once a day and send it to a specific e-mail address.

- You don't need any interaction with the program. It will be a service that runs automatically.
- The data should be collected from the Basketball Reference Website in the resources area.
- You should use the Agility Pack library for scraping.
